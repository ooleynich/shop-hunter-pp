##2. Sharing Your Information

The developer will share personal information with third parties only in the ways that are 
described in this privacy statement.

Your personal information may be disclosed:

* As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
* To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.


##3. What information are collected and why

###3.1 Yandex Metrica

Yandex Metrica a free web analytics service provided by Yandex that tracks and reports on all traffic that passes through your website or app. It also allow you to review the performance of your online ad campaigns by tracking site visits, conversion rates, and other key metrics.

Yandex Metrica mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Yandex Metrica customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.

In addition, Yandex Metrica supports an optional browser add-on that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Yandex Metrica for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Yandex Metrica measurement.

Where a site or app uses Yandex Metrica for Apps, Yandex Metrica collects an app-instance identifier — a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.

Where sites or apps have implemented Yandex Metrica with other Yandex Advertising products, like Yandex Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie using the Ads Settings.

Yandex Metrica also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give website owners a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as "IP geolocation"). Yandex Metrica provides a method to mask IPs that are collected (detailed below) but note that website owners have access to their users’ IP addresses even if the website owners do not use Yandex Metrica.

Yandex uses Yandex Metrica data to provide the Yandex Analytics measurement service to customers. Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure user interactions with a customer’s sites and/or apps, while IP addresses are used to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give the customer a sense of where in the world their users come from.

##5. Security

I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your Personal

electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
security.

no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or 
practices of any third-party sites or services.
